# Password Manager
IN PROGRESS (--working on cryptography--)

Password Manager allows user to create, store and manage his passwords inside one desktop application.
Passwords manager uses MySQL DBMS and specific cryptography algorithms to store passwords safely inside database. It uses PySimpleGUI interface to "communicate"
with user and uses hasing algorithms to manage master passwords.

The main idea of this project is safety. That is why it is still in process. We believe, we'll make it even more safe with the help of 
blockchain technologies and smart contracts.
